![Main Screen](/DemoScreenshots/twit1.PNG?raw=true "Main Screen")

Main screen of the application. Can go to a list of a user's tweets with their name, or can search using google (did not implement log in, so the search api cannot be used). Searches are persistant between use. 


![User Page](/DemoScreenshots/twit2.PNG?raw=true "User Page")

Activity that displays a list of the user's last tweets. Has menu options to "stalk" the user, getting notifications when they tweet, or opening a webview to view the user's page.


![Notification](/DemoScreenshots/twit3.PNG?raw=true "Notification")

Notification that displays on a new tweet.
